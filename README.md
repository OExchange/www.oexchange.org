OExchange Web
=============

### What's Here? ###

The source for everything on www.oexchange.org, including:
 
* The [OExchange spec](http://github.com/OExchange/www.oexchange.org/tree/master/webroot/spec/) 

* Various [tools](http://github.com/OExchange/www.oexchange.org/tree/master/webroot/tools/) to help OExchange development

* Some PHP utility code, [lib-oexchange](http://github.com/OExchange/www.oexchange.org/tree/master/webroot/lib-oexchange/), currently part of the site but might some day be separated

* The home page, quickstart, all that

Other things are in other repos in the [OExchange account](http://github.com/OExchange).

### Running Locally ###

The root of the site is /webroot.  To run it locally, just point an Apache/PHP setup to it (xampp for example).  

The site is self-contained and there are no complex or additional  dependencies.

### Deploying ###

Dirt simple, if you have the approval:

`deploy.sh <username>`
