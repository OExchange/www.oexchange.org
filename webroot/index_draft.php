            <h3>The Problem</h4>
            <p>
                There is a whole world of services &mdash; social networks, communication tools, social news and bookmarking sites &mdash; with more 
                appearing every day. Many do not accept content the same way. It's hard to know which service a user wants, and how to share content there.
            </p>
            
            <h3>OExchange Provides</h4>
            <p>
                A standard way for services to be more easily integrated into sharing tools, by making them automatically 
                discoverable. A standard way to receive content, making it easier to communicate with sharing tools. 
                A decentralized model for saving and displaying a user's preferred services.

<p>
	Tweeting on Twitter?  Sharing on Facebook?  Sure thing.  But what about posting to your favorite off-beat forum?  Or translating and printing?  What if your browser and your sharing tools could automatically figure out what options make sense for you, as you browse the web?
</p>
<p>OExchange defines:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A standard HTTP endpoint for sending URL content to a web-based service (like http://www.example.com/post?url=http://www.youface.com).</li>
	<li>A way for services to make themselves discoverable automatically (via XRD and .well-known/host-meta).</li>
	<li>A decentralized, user-centric method for tools to store personal service preferences on behalf of users (via WebFinger)</li>	
</ul>
<p>This specification is interoperable now, with <strong>services live on the web today</strong>.</p>
